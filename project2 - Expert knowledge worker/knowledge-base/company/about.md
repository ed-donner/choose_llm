# About Insurellm

Insurellm was founded by Avery Lancaster in 2015 as an insurance tech startup designed to disrupt an industry in need of innovative products. Its first product was Markellm, the marketplace connecting consumers with insurance providers.

The company experienced rapid growth in its first five years, expanding its product portfolio to include Carllm (auto insurance portal), Homellm (home insurance portal), and Rellm (enterprise reinsurance platform). By 2020, Insurellm had reached a peak of 200 employees with 12 offices across the US.

However, the company underwent a strategic restructuring in 2022-2023 to focus on profitability and sustainable growth. This included consolidating office locations, implementing a remote-first strategy, and streamlining operations. As of 2025, Insurellm operates with a lean, highly efficient team of 32 employees who have built a portfolio of 32 active contracts spanning all eight product lines. The company maintains its San Francisco headquarters along with small satellite offices in key markets including New York, Austin, Chicago, and Denver.

Since the restructuring, Insurellm has continued to innovate, expanding its product suite to eight comprehensive platforms. The company added Lifellm (life insurance), Healthllm (health insurance), Bizllm (commercial insurance), and Claimllm (claims processing) to serve the full spectrum of insurance needs. This strategic expansion has been highly successful, with strong adoption across all new products:

- **Bizllm** quickly gained traction with 7 commercial insurance contracts, including regional carriers and national commercial groups
- **Claimllm** signed 7 contracts ranging from independent adjusting firms to enterprise claims networks
- **Lifellm** secured 6 life insurance clients from small regional providers to major national carriers
- **Healthllm** won 6 health plan contracts including regional insurers and multi-state healthcare alliances

Combined with continued growth in the original product lines (Carllm, Homellm, Markellm, and Rellm), Insurellm now serves clients ranging from regional insurers to global reinsurance partners, demonstrating the company's ability to compete across the entire insurance value chain.
