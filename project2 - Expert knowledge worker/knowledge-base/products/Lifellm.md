### 5. Smart Document Processing
Lifellm utilizes natural language processing and optical character recognition to automatically extract and validate information from medical records, applications, and supporting documentation, significantly reducing manual data entry.

### 6. Customer Portal
A user-friendly portal enables policyholders to manage their coverage, update beneficiaries, access policy documents, and track wellness incentives 24/7. Mobile app integration ensures customers can manage their life insurance anywhere.
